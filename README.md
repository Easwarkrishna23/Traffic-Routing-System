# Traffic-Routing-System
This project implements a dual-function system using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. The system combines traffic routing using Dijkstra's algorithm and secure communication via RSA encryption.


Key Features:
Traffic Routing System:

Allows users to input source and destination locations.
Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a predefined road network.
Displays the route and the total distance.
Visualizes the network graph with the shortest path highlighted.
Secure Communication:

Implements RSA public and private key encryption.
Users can encrypt and decrypt messages using RSA keys.
Ensures secure communication by providing encryption and decryption features directly within the GUI.
Technologies Used:
Tkinter: For creating the GUI.
NetworkX: For graph handling and shortest path calculation.
Matplotlib: For visualizing the traffic network graph.
PyCryptodome: For RSA encryption and decryption.
This project is an example of integrating graph theory and cryptography into a user-friendly interface for real-world applications.
